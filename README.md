### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è S3 Upload

![S3 Upload](./assets/s3-upload.png)

> üí° If you copy the image URL and open it, the browser will show (Access Denied) ‚Äî because your bucket is private.

![Access Denied](./assets/Access-Denied.png)

#### üö´ Why this matters:
- Prevents accidental data exposure üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Protects sensitive information üîí
- Follows security best practices ‚úÖ
- Avoids the "oops, I made my bucket public" mistake that's cost companies millions üí∏

### üóÇÔ∏è Organize S3 Bucket

> üìÇ To organize your bucket structure ‚Äî **create a folder**

> üì§ Move the uploaded image to the **folder**

![Move](./assets/Move.png)

#### üìÅ Why organize?
- Makes finding files easier as your project grows üß≠
- Follows development best practices üö¶
- Helps with permissions and access control later üõ°Ô∏è
- Keeps things cleaner than your desktop üßπ

### üí∏ Understanding Costs & Credit Balance

- **Storage:** ~$0.023 per GB per month (US East region)\*
- **Requests:** ~$0.0004 per 1,000 GET requests, $0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests
- **Data transfer:** First 100 GB per month is always free
- Pricing varies by AWS region.

## üåê Upload Website to S3

**Download Website from** ‚Äî [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sCNufDD8XUl-UhKkXzNwj4XH7bwsU4t/view?usp=sharing)

**CV.html** ‚Äî Contains all (**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**)

![Website](./assets/Website-Upload.png)

When you **copy** the **Object URL** and **paste** it in a new tab, it **appears** as **'Access Denied'**.

**This is important:** Your files are securely stored and not publicly accessible.

## üåç Create CloudFront (CDN) ‚Äî Global Distribution

```bash
Create a CloudFront distribution
Distribution name: Rift Rewind Global Distribution
Distribution type: Single website or app
Skip custom domain setup 
Next
Origin type: Amazon S3
S3 origin: Click "Browse S3" and select your bucket 
Origin path: Leave empty
Skip security protections - Choose "Do not enable security protections" 
Next
Create distribution
```

![CloudFront](./assets/CloudFront.png)

### üè† Configure Your Default Page

> **Set a default root object** to make your domain automatically serve your main page when users access your root URL

![Default Root Object](./assets/Default-Root-Object.png)

---

### üü¢ CloudFront Output

![Output](./assets/CloudFront-Output.png)

**What happened behind the scenes:**  
AWS automatically created an Origin Access Control (OAC) and updated your S3 bucket policy.  
Think of OAC like giving your CDN a special VIP pass to your private storage.  
Users can get content through the CDN, but they can't access your storage directly ‚Äî only CloudFront has the VIP pass. üõÇ

---

## üöÄ Deploy Using (GitHub, Amplify)

- Created GitHub account and repository
- Uploaded project files to GitHub
- Deployed project using Amplify + GitHub integration
- Tested automatic deployment by making a code change
- Cleaned up original CloudFront distribution

The CloudFront URL might look ugly now (like `d1234567890123.cloudfront.net`), but later you can connect it to a **custom domain name** to make it look professional. üåê

### üèÜ What You Will Accomplish

- Store your project code on GitHub üóÉÔ∏è
- Deploy using AWS Amplify with automatic deployments ‚ö°
- Clean up your manual CloudFront + S3 setup (to save your Free Tier credits) üßπ

---

### üì¶ Create GitHub Repository

> Upload your files to **GitHub** ‚Äî keep your project versioned and ready for collaboration! ü§ù

![GitHub](./assets/GitHub.png)

### üöß Create AWS Amplify

- **Navigate to Amplify** ‚Äî In AWS Console
- **Create new app** ‚Äî Click "**Deploy an app**"
- **Choose source code provider** ‚Äî Select "**GitHub**" and click "**Next**"
- **Authorize GitHub** ‚Äî Click "**Authorize AWS Amplify**" and sign in to GitHub if prompted
- **Update GitHub permissions** ‚Äî Click "**Update GitHub permissions**". You'll be redirected to GitHub to configure AWS Amplify on your GitHub account:
  - Choose "**Only select repositories**"
  - **Select repository**
  - Click "**Install & Authorize**"
- **Select repository** in AWS Amplify
- branch: **main**
- Next

### üîÑ‚ö° Test Automatic Deployments

> Edit **index.html** ‚Äî Add pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to indicate edit

![Deploy](./assets/Deploy.png)

#### üöÄ Output
